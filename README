# matlab_scripts
Useful matlab scripts from various sources including myself: Nicolas Jourdain <nicolas.jourdain@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr>

To have all the functions available, add the following two lines in ~/matlab/startup.m (create this file if not yet created, and adapt 'xxxxxx') :
addpath('xxxxxx/matlab_scripts')
addpath('xxxxxx/matlab_scripts/colorbar')
